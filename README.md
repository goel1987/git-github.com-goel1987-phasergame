# git-github.com-goel1987-phasergame\

I filled out the self evaluation and reflection *
I set up github pages for this project *
I submitted the repository link *

I felt I understood the fundamentals of the project. I ran into errors and was not able to figure out how to fix them

I feel like I deserve a 10. I made an effort but I fell short

It took me about 10 days
